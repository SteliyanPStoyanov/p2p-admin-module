                <li>General provisions</li>
                <p>This item has been developed on the basis of the applicable legislation regulating customer complaints in connection with the activity of Afranga. The main goal of this policy is for the complaints of the company’s clients to be resolved fairly and within the pre-established deadlines for response.</p>
                <li>Consideration of complaints</li>
                <p>Our representative accepts customer complaints and submits them no later than the end of the next business day for consideration by the manager. The manager then gets acquainted with the complaint and stops contact with our customer. When the complaint is fully or partially justified, the manager makes every effort to satisfy the client's claims and prevent potential litigation.</p>
                <li>Categories of complaints according to the order of their receipt
                    <p>A complaint, within the meaning of this point, is any oral or written expression of dissatisfaction, suggestion or remark of a client regarding the quality of the provided services. Afranga groups the complaints of its clients according to the manner of their receipt as:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>customer complaints sent to the official e-mail of Afranga;</li>
                        <li>written complaints submitted to Afranga;</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Written complaints of clients forwarded to Afranga through supervisory or other administrative and state bodies (Bulgarian National Bank, Consumer Protection Commission, Personal Data Protection Commission, Competition Protection Commission, etc.).</p>
                </li>
                <li>Deadlines for responding to customer complaints</li>
                <p> Afranga prepares answers to complaints within 30 business days from the date of receipt of the complaint, and in case of factual or legal complexity the term may be extended, for which the complainant is explicitly notified.</p>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>XI. Changes to this privacy policy</strong></p>
