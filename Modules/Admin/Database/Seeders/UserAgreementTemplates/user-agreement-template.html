                    standards including to update the password frequently, keep it in a secure manner and not disclose
                    it
                    to third parties. For security purposes, Afranga may impose additional security rules for the
                    length,
                    storage or additional password requirements.</p>
                <p><strong>4.2. </strong>In case the User’s password has become known or the User suspects the password could have
                    been leaked, the User must immediately inform Afranga. For security purposes, Afranga can block the
                    access to the respective User’s Profile as soon as possible, until the User is given a new password
                    and the User has given an instruction to Afranga to unblock his Profile.</p>
                <p><strong>4.3</strong> Afranga can temporarily suspend access to the User’s profile in case his password is entered

                    Profile has been accessed without due authorization or the company has suspicions of the execution
                    of illegal transactions. This right is also reserved for other cases which ensure the safety of the
                    company’s services, confidentiality of the User and/or Afranga’ s Platform or to prevent losses for
                    Afranga and/ or its Users.</p>
                <p><strong>4.5. </strong>Afranga reserves the right not to approve a transaction and/or not to execute any instructions
                    provided by the User or services to the User in case:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the User does not comply with the current Terms and Conditions;</li>
                    <li>Afranga has suspicions about the identity of the User and at the same time the company has
                        not been able to contact the User to confirm the rationale of the transaction;</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>4.6. </strong>The User is aware that any third parties, who have obtained the User’s password or two factor
                    authentication credentials, can access the User’s Profile and assume obligations on behalf of the
                    User. If the User’s Profile is used to carry out activities on the Platform using correct
                    credentials of the

                    Profile
                    have been performed by the User himself.</p>
